# Breast Cancer Outcome Prediction

This project uses supervised machine learning techniques to predict breast cancer patient outcomes based on clinical data. It includes classification models to predict mortality status and regression models to estimate survival months.

## Features

- Data preprocessing including cleaning, feature encoding, and outlier handling
- Classification models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Regression model: Decision Tree Regressor
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Model evaluation using Accuracy, AUC-ROC, RÂ², MAE, and MSE metrics
- Focus on interpretability, generalization, and clinical relevance

## Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
- matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries (e.g., via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks to explore data preprocessing, model training, tuning, and evaluation

## Notebooks

- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis
- Classification models for mortality prediction
- Regression model for survival month estimation
